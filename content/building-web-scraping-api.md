# Introducing Deep Research API

Today, we're excited to announce the launch of our new Deep Research API, a groundbreaking addition to the Firecrawl platform that takes web scraping to the next level.

## What is Deep Research API?

Deep Research API is an autonomous, AI-powered research assistant that can navigate the web, collect relevant information, and synthesize findings on any topic. Unlike traditional web scraping that requires predefined selectors and patterns, Deep Research API understands context and can adapt its collection strategy based on the content it discovers.

## Key Features

### Autonomous Navigation

- Intelligently follows relevant links
- Prioritizes authoritative sources
- Avoids content traps and honeypots

### Comprehensive Analysis

- Extracts key facts and statistics
- Identifies conflicting information
- Summarizes findings with proper attribution

### Flexible Output Formats

- Structured JSON for data integration
- Markdown reports for human readability
- Citation graphs for source verification

## Use Cases

Deep Research API is ideal for a wide range of applications:

1. **Market Research**: Gather competitive intelligence and industry trends
2. **Academic Research**: Collect and synthesize information across multiple sources
3. **Content Creation**: Generate well-researched briefs for articles and reports
4. **Due Diligence**: Compile comprehensive profiles on companies or individuals

## Getting Started

The Deep Research API is available today for all Enterprise customers and as an add-on for Pro users. To get started:

1. Log in to your Firecrawl dashboard
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Select "Deep Research" from the available endpoints
4. Follow our quickstart guide to make your first research request

## Pricing and Availability

Deep Research API is priced based on the complexity and depth of research required. Basic research starts at 10 credits per request, with more comprehensive research using up to 50 credits depending on scope.

We're offering all customers 100 free credits to try the Deep Research API during our launch period.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the capabilities of our Deep Research API!
