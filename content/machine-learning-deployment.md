# Introduction to ML Model Deployment

Deploying machine learning models to production is a crucial yet challenging aspect of the ML lifecycle. Success requires careful consideration of infrastructure, monitoring, and maintenance strategies.

Key aspects of successful ML deployment include:

- Model serving infrastructure and scaling strategies
- Monitoring and observability solutions
- Version control and model registry management
- Testing and validation pipelines

## Common Deployment Strategies

There are several proven approaches to deploying ML models effectively:

### Containerized Deployment

- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Cloud-native deployment options

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Effective monitoring is crucial for production ML systems:

### Essential Metrics

- Model performance and accuracy
- System resource utilization
- Prediction latency and throughput
- Data drift and model decay

### Maintenance Best Practices

- Regular model retraining
- A/B testing new versions
- Automated rollback procedures
- Documentation and change management

## Infrastructure Considerations

Choosing the right infrastructure is critical:

### Serving Infrastructure

- Cloud vs on-premise deployment
- GPU vs CPU optimization
- Load balancing strategies
- Auto-scaling policies
